I am currently looking for Open Source projects to contribute to! If you have something you think I might be interested in, please let me know.


I work as a Software Engineer at [CUBRC, Inc.](http://www.cubrc.org/) and am a Masters student at the [UCSD's Computer Science Department](http://cse.ucsd.edu/). **Quick Disclaimer: The opinions on this website are my own and do not reflect the opinions of UCSD or CUBRC, (phew) **. I have opinions that [I want to share](http://dsnyder.github.com). I like to [code](http://www.github.com/dsnyder) outside of work when I can. I love sailing, by the way and dream of owning a sailboat out here in San Diego.
