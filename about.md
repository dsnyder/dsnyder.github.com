I am currently looking for Open Source projects to contribute to! If you have something you think I might be interested in, please let me know.


I have opinions that [I want to share](http://dsnyder.github.com). I like to [code](http://www.github.com/dsnyder) outside of work when I can. I love sailing, by the way and dream of owning a sailboat out here in San Diego.
###about:career
I currently work as a Software Engineer at [CUBRC, Inc.](http://www.cubrc.org/). 

Prior to that I spent three years as a software developer at the [Space and Naval Warfare System Center, Pacific](http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sandiego/).


I feel like I spent way too much time in school. Recently becoming a Masters student at the [UCSD's Computer Science Department](http://cse.ucsd.edu/) confirms my insanity. 
I received a B.S. in [Mathematics](http://www.math.rochester.edu/) and a B.A. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/) at the [University of Rochester](http://www.rochester.edu). 
I even managed to squeeze in a minor in [Philosophy](http://www.rochester.edu/college/phl). And waaay back, like the mid 2000s (not 2050) I received an A.A. in Humanities from [Monroe Community College](http://www.monroecc.edu/),
which comprised of reading a lot of books and writing about them. Fun times.
